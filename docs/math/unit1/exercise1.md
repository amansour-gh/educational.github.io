# Unit One : Numbers and operations on them
## exercise One : Proportion
1. Complete the following:  
    1. The proportion is <span style="color:green">an equality of at least two ratios or two rates</span>  
    2. If two ratios are equal, then the product of the extremes = <span style="color:green">Means</span>
    3. 
    $$
    \frac{X}{15} = \frac{3}{5}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{3 \times 15}{5}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{45}{5} = 9
    $$  
    4. 
    $$
    \frac{20}{25} = \frac{36}{X}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{25 \times 36}{20}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{900}{20} = 45
    $$
