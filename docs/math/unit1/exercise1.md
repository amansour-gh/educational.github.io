# Unit One : Numbers and operations on them
## exercise One : Proportion  
### Question 1
1. Complete the following:  
    1.The proportion is <span style="color:green">an equality of at least two ratios or two rates</span>  
    2.If two ratios are equal, then the product of the extremes = <span style="color:green">Means</span>  
    
    3.
    $$
    \frac{X}{15} = \frac{3}{5}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{3 \times 15}{5}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{45}{5} = 9
    $$  
    4.
    $$
    \frac{20}{25} = \frac{36}{X}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{25 \times 36}{20}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{900}{20} = 45
    $$  
    5.
    $$
    \frac{48}{72} = \frac{X}{15}
    $$  
    $$
    X = \frac{15 \times 48}{72} = \frac{720}{72} = 10
    $$  
    6.
    $$
    \frac{12}{X} = \frac{18}{12} 
    $$  
    $$
    X = \frac{12 \times 12}{18} = \frac{144}{18} = 8
    $$  
    7.
    $$
    \frac{6}{8} = \frac{X}{Y} 
    $$  
    we can divide or multiply both terms in the same number to get any equivalent fraction 
    $$
    \frac{6 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{3}{4}
    $$  
    8.
    $$
    \frac{12}{X} = \frac{Y}{15}
    $$  
    to solve this we can multiply Means 15 \times 12 = 180 then divide 180 for any number like 10 to get answer equal 18 to be as following  
    $$
    \frac{12}{18} = \frac{10}{15}
    $$  
    or we can solve it as the following  
    $$
    Y = 12 \div 3 = 4
    $$  
    $$
    X = 15 \times 3 = 45
    $$  
### Question 2  

2. Which of the following represents a proportion:  

    1. 
    $$
    \frac{2}{5} and \frac{4}{10}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 2 \times 10 = 20  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 4 \times 5 = 20  
    $$  
    **Extremes = Means this represent a proportion**  
    
    2.
    $$
    \frac{3}{4} and \frac{6}{9}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 3 \times 9 = 27  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 4 \times 6 = 24  
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes \neq Means 
    $$  
    **This represent a not proportion**  
    
    3.
    $$
    \frac{15}{25} and \frac{30}{60}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 15 \times 60 = 900  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 25 \times 30 = 750  
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes \neq Means 
    $$  
    **This represent a not proportion**  
    
    4.
    $$
    \frac{1}{3} and \frac{0.5}{1.5}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 1 \times 1.5 = 1.5  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 3 \times 0.5 = 1.5  
    $$  
    **Extremes = Means this represent a proportion**  
    
    5.
    $$
    \frac{5}{4} and \frac{7.5}{6}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 5 \times 6 = 30  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 4 \times 7.5 = 30  
    $$  
    **Extremes = Means this represent a proportion**  
    
    6.
    $$
    \frac{10}{3} and \frac{40}{12}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 10 \times 12 = 120  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 3 \times 40 = 120  
    $$  
    **Extremes = Means this represent a proportion**  
### Question 3  

3. For each of the following proportion, determine whether the quantities are proportional. **If** the --- , write the proportion.  

    1. 5, 8, 15, 24
    $$
    Extremes = 5 \times 24 = 120
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 8 \times 15 = 120
    $$  
    Extremes = Means **this is proportinal quantities**  

    2. 7, 8, 14, 15
    $$
    Extremes = 7 \times 15 = 105
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 8 \times 14 = 112
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes \neq Means
    $$  
    **this is NOT proportinal quantities**  
    
    3. 12, 27, 16, 18
    $$
    Extremes = 12 \times 18 = 216
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 27 \times 16 = 432
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes \neq Means
    $$  
    **this is NOT proportinal quantities**  
    
    4. 8, 24, 6, 18
    $$
    Extremes = 8 \times 18 = 144
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 24 \times 6 = 144
    $$  
    Extremes = Means **this is proportinal quantities**  

### Question 4
4. Solve the following proportions:  
   1. 
   $$
   \frac{3}{4} = \frac{X}{20}
   $$  
   $$
   X = \frac{20 \times 3}{4} =\frac{60}{4} = 15
   $$  
   
   2. 
   $$
   \frac{6}{X} = \frac{12}{14}
   $$  
   $$
   X = \frac{6 \times 14}{12} = \frac{84}{12} = 7
   $$  

   3. 
   $$
   \frac{15}{X} =\frac{30}{12}
   $$
   $$
   X = \frac{15 \times 12}{30} = \frac{180}{30} = 30
   $$  

   4. a : 16 = 5 : 4  
   
   $$
   \frac{A}{16} = \frac{5}{4}
   $$
   $$
   A = \frac{16 \times 5}{4} = \frac{80}{4} = 20
   $$  

   5. 7 : 8 = 21 : M
   $$
   M = \frac{8 \times 21}{7} = \frac{168}{7} = 24
   $$  
   
   6. $$
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{B + 1}
   $$
   $$
   B + 1 = \frac{2 \times 3}{1} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
   $$
   $$
   B = 6 - 1 = 5
   $$  

   7. 
   $$
   \frac{L - 3}{12} = \frac{5}{4}
   $$
   $$
   L - 3 = \frac{12 \times 5}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15
   $$
   $$
   L = 15 + 3 = 18
   $$  

   8. 
   $$
   \frac{16}{3X} = \frac{8}{12}
   $$
   $$
   3X = \frac{16 \times 12}{8} = \frac{192}{8} = 24
   $$
   $$
   X = \frac{24}{3} = 8
   $$  

   9. 
   $$
   \frac{8}{Y} = \frac{Y}{2}
   $$
   $$
   2Y = 16
   $$
   $$
   Y = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   $$
