# Unit One : Numbers and operations on them
## exercise One : Proportion
1. Complete the following:  
    1. The proportion is <span style="color:green">an equality of at least two ratios or two rates</span>  
    2. If two ratios are equal, then the product of the extremes = <span style="color:green">Means</span>
    3. 
    $$
    \frac{X}{15} = \frac{3}{5}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{3 \times 15}{5}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{45}{5} = 9
    $$  
    4. 
    $$
    \frac{20}{25} = \frac{36}{X}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{25 \times 36}{20}
    $$  
    
    $$
    X = \frac{900}{20} = 45
    $$  
    5. 
    $$
    \frac{48}{72} = \frac{X}{15}
    $$  
    $$
    X = \frac{15 \times 48}{72} = \frac{720}{72} = 10
    $$  
    6. 
    $$
    \frac{12}{X} = \frac{18}{12} 
    $$  
    $$
    X = \frac{12 \times 12}{18} = \frac{144}{18} = 8
    $$  
    7. 
    $$
    \frac{6}{8} = \frac{X}{Y} 
    $$  
    we can divide or multiply both terms in the same number to get any equivalent fraction 
    $$
    \frac{6 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{3}{4}
    $$  
    8. 
    $$
    \frac{12}{X} = \frac{Y}{15}
    $$  
    > to solve this we can multiply Means 15 \times 12 = 180 then divide 180 for any number like 10 to get answer equal 18 to be as following  
    $$
    \frac{12}{18} = \frac{10}{15}
    $$  
    > or we can solve it as the following  
    $$
    Y = 12 \div 3 = 4
    $$  
    $$
    X = 15 \times 3 = 45
    $$

2. Which of the following represents a proportion:  
    1. 
    $$
    \frac{2}{5} and \frac{4}{10}
    $$  
    $$
    Extremes = 2 \times 10 = 20  
    $$  
    $$
    Means = 4 \times 5 = 20  
    $$  
    Extremes = Means this represent a proportion
