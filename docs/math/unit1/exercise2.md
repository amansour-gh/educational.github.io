# Unit One : Numbers and operations on them
## Lesson Two : Applications of Ratio and Proportion (First) Scale Drawing  

1.  Complete the following:
    1.  The scale drawing =     <span style="color:green"> $\frac{The \, length \, in \, the \, drawing}{the \, real \, length}$   </span>  
    2.  If the scale drawing > 1, it represents <span style="color:green">Magnification</span> , but if the scale drawing < 1, it represents <span style="color:green">Minimization</span>
    3.  If the scale drawing is 1 : 200 , it represents <span style="color:green">Minimization</span>
    4.  if the length in the drawing is 5 cm and the real length is 15 meters, then the scale drawing =     <span style="color:green"> $\frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3}$ </span>  
    5.  If the length of insect in the picture is 4 cm and its real length is 2 mm, then the scal drawing = <span style="color:green">$\frac{4 \times 10}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = \frac{20}{1}$</span>
2.  **Geography :** If the real distance between cairo and Damietta is 200 km and the distance between them on the map is 5 cm, find the map's scale drawing  

    <span style="color:green"> The scale drwaing = $\frac{5\,cm}{200\,km} = \frac{5}{200} = \frac{1}{40}$ </span>  
<br>

3.  **Public Domain :** A model of the cairo Tower was created at scale drawing of 1 : 200 . Given that the hieght of the Cairo Tower is 187 meters, what is the length of the model tower in **cm** ?  

    <span style="color:green"> $\frac{1}{200} = \frac{The\, model\,length}{187\, m}$  
    <br>
    The model length = $\frac{187 \times 100}{200} = 93.5\,cm$</span>
    
    
4.  A magnifying lens is used to magnify an insect. if the real length of the insect is 0.4 mm, and itslength after magnification is 4.8 cm. Find the magnification ratio? 

    <span style="color:green">$\frac{4.8\,cm}{0.4\,mm} = \frac{4.8 \times 10}{0.4} = \frac{48}{0.4} = \frac{480}{4} = \frac{120}{1}$ </span>  

5.  Mustafa drew a picture of his brother Ahmed if the scale drawing is 1 : 4 and Ahmed's height is 160 cm, what is Ahmed's height in the picture?

    <span style="color:green">$\frac{1}{4} = \frac{Ahmed\, height \, in\, picture}{160\,cm}$  
    <br>
    Ahmed Hight in picture = $\frac{160}{4} = \frac{40}{1} = 40\,cm$  </span>
