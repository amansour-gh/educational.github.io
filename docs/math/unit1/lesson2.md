# Unit One : Numbers and operations on them
## Lesson Two : Applications of Ratio and Proportion (First) Scale Drawing  

### Concept of Scale Drawing  

**It is a ratio of the dimention in the drawing or model to the dimention in reality**  


### Example 1  

a. if the distance between two cities is 80 km and the the distance between them on the map is 4 cm, find the scale drawing for this map  

$$ The \, scale \, drawing \, = \frac{The \, length \, in \, the \, drawing}{the \, real \, length} = \frac{4 \, cm}{80 \, Km} = \frac{4}{8,000,000} = \frac{1}{2,000,000} $$  
The scale drawing can be written as 1 : 2,000,000


b. An enlarged picture of an insect, its real length is 0.5 mm and its length in the picture is 7.5 cm, find the scale drawing.
   The length in the drawing = 
   $$ 7.5 \, cm = 7.5 \times 10 \, mm = 75 \, mm $$
   $$ Ratio = \frac{75}{0.5} = \frac{75 \times 10}{0.5 \times 10} = \frac{750}{5} = \frac{750 \div 5}{5 \div 5} = \frac{150}{1} $$
   
   That means every 150 mm in the drawing = 1 mm in the real **150:1**

### Note  
if the scale drawing is **greater than 1** the scale drawing for **magnification**  
Such as: 100: 1 , 350 : 1  

if the scale drawing is **Less than 1** the scale drawing for **minimization**  
Such as: 1 : 300 , 1 : 750  


### Example 2  

if the scale drawing in the map is 1 : 500,000 and the distance between two cities on the map is 3 cm, find the real distance between the two cities.  

**Solution**  

$$ The \, scale \, drawing = \frac{The \, distance \, on \, the \, map}{the \, real \, distance} $$
